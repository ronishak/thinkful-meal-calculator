For your finished project you need to be able to:

- Create diner objects which represent a single diner.
- Add dishes to a diner's meal
- Total up the cost of all of the diner's meals
- Add a fixed tax percentage to the total bill
- dd a percentage tip to the total bill
- Split the bill fairly among the diners
- Each diner should pay the tax on their own food
- Each diner should pay an equal share of the tip
- If you choose to round the amounts, you may notice that the sum of the amounts does not equal the total bill - amount anymore. Don't worry about that, or distribute the disrepancy in a fair way for an extra challenge.
- Print out a total bill
- Print a breakdown for what each diner owes
